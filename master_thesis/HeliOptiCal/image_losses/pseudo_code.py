# Test calibration loss per image sample of test data set. 
# Load test data

# Loop over every image in test data set
# Calibrate kinematic parameters per sample image

# for first 100 epochs calibrate with alignment error on reflection axis
# Loss = MSE (shaded image - raytracer image) or contours
# Loss Test = Error of (Reflection Axis - Predicted reflection axis)

# validate with ideal flux center (real reflection axis)

# plot: sample image / predicted image / contours for both / diff plots
# per sample show loss curve over epochs
# maybe plot gradients
